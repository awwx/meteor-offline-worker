// be called with one argument, the "retry function." If the package
// is ready to migrate, it should return [true, data], where data is
// its migration data, an arbitrary JSON value (or [true] if it has
// no migration data this time). If the package needs more time
// before it is ready to migrate, it should return false. Then, once
// it is ready to migrating again, it should call the retry
// function. The retry function will return immediately, but will
// schedule the migration to be retried, meaning that every package
// will be polled once again for its migration data. If they are all
// ready this time, then the migration will happen. name must be set if there
// is migration data.
